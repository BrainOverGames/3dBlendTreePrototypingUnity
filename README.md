# 3d BlendTree Prototyping in Unity
Quick prototyping of blend tree in animations for 3d models
 
## One of the most important benefit of blend tree
Fluid blend between different animations based on velocity using 1 input key(any WASD or arrow key).

0-0.5 -> walk animations

0.5-1 -> run animations (if you want it to run using differrent key, then create separate run blend tree & map it with different key(Left shift))

Example, INSIDE game changes walk/run animations when boy speed changes by just using 1 input key.
